This client is a sample lua interpreter.
It can be used as a batch interpreter and interactively.
Here are the options it understands:

  -v       print version information
  -d       turn debug on
  -e stat  dostring `stat'
  -q       interactive mode without prompt
  -i       interactive mode with prompt
  -        executes stdin as a file
  a=b      sets global `a' with string `b' (no need to quote b)
  name     dofile `name'

If no options are given, then it reads and executes lines from stdin.
In this case, each line must contain a complete statement.
To span a statement across several lines, end each line with a backslash '\'.
To change the prompt, set the global variable _PROMPT to whatever you want.

This interpreter is good for using Lua as a standalone language.
For a minimal interpreter, see etc/min.c.
