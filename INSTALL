* Installation

  Building Lua on a Unix system should be very easy:

	1. Edit "config" to suit your platform, if at all necessary.
	2. Then, type "make".

  See below for instructions for Windows and Macintosh.

* What you get

  If "make" succeeds, you get:
	* an interpreter in ./bin/lua and a compiler in ./bin/luac;
	* libraries in ./lib;
	* include files in ./include.
  These are the only directories you need for development.

  There is a reference manual in html in ./doc, some sample code in ./test,
  and some useful stuff in ./etc.
  You don't need these directories for development.

* If you have problems (and solutions!)

  If "make" fails, please let us know (lua@tecgraf.puc-rio.br).
  If you make changes to "config", please send them to us.

* Shared libraries

  If you are running SunOs 4.x, type the following after "make" succeeds:
	ld -o lib/liblua.so.3.1 src/*.o
	ld -o lib/liblualib.so.3.1 src/lib/*.o

  If you want the interpreter to use shared libraries, then do:
	rm bin/lua
	cd src/lua; make

  For AIX, the OpenGL clone Mesa includes a script for making shared libraries.
  For other systems, please tell us how!

* Installation on Windows or Macintosh

  The instructions for building Lua on a Mac or Windows machine depend on
  the particular compiler you are using.
  The simplest way is to create a folder with all .c and .h files.
  Then create projects for the basic library, the standard library,
  the interpreter and the compiler, as follows:

  basic lib:	lapi.c lauxlib.c lbuffer.c lbuiltin.c ldo.c lfunc.c lgc.c
		llex.c lmem.c lobject.c lparser.c lstate.c lstring.c ltable.c
		ltm.c lundump.c lvm.c lzio.c

  standard lib:	liolib.c lmathlib.c lstrlib.c

  interpreter:	basic lib, standard lib, lua.c

  compiler:	basic lib, dump.c luac.c print.c stubs.c opcode.c opt.c

  Of course, to use Lua as a library, you'll have to know how to create
  and use libraries with your compiler.
