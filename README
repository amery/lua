* What is Lua?
  Lua is a simple, yet powerful, language for extending applications.
  Lua has been developed by TeCGraf, the Computer Graphics Technology Group
  of PUC-Rio, the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
  Dozens of industrial products developed by TeCGraf use Lua.

* Some features of Lua
  + a simple, pascal-like, syntax
  + powerful data description constructs (e.g., associative arrays)
  + user-controlled type constructors
  + fallbacks for extending the language in unconventional ways (e.g.,
    inheritance, overloading)
  + garbage collection
  + Lua programs are compiled into bytecodes, which are then interpreted
  + portable, written in ANSI C (runs in Unix, DOS, Windows, Mac, Cray, ...)

* Legal matters
  Lua is freely available for both academic and commercial purposes.
  Lua is not in the public domain; TeCGraf keeps its copyright.
  See COPYRIGHT.

* Changes since version 2.1  (current version is 2.2)
  + functions now may be declared with any "lvalue" as a name
  + garbage collection of functions
  + support for pipes

* Changes since version 1.1
  + object-oriented support
  + fallbacks
  + simplified syntax for tables
  + many internal improvements

* Installing
  To make, simply type domake.
  If make succeeds, you get an interpreter in ./bin/lua.
  If make fails, please let me know.
  The libraries are in ./lib.  The include files are in ./include.
  You don't need the other directories for development.
  There is a reference manual in ./doc, and tests and examples in ./test.
  This distribution is biased towards SunOS 4 with gcc but it is simple to
  change the Makefiles for other systems, if necessary.
  If you are running SunOs, type also "domake dynamic" to build shared
  libraries in ./lib.
  If your system does not have "popen", then change ./clients/lib/Makefile.

* Contacting the authors
  Send your comments, bug reports and anything else to lhf@icad.puc-rio.br.
  Please send me email if you download Lua so that we can know how far it goes.
