This directory contains some code that might be useful.

bin2c.c
	This program converts files to byte arrays that are automatically
	run with lua_dobuffer.
	This allows C programs to include all necessary Lua code, even in
	precompiled form.
	Even if code is include in source form, bin2c is useful because it
	avoids the hassle of having to quote special characters in C strings.
	Example of usage: run bin2c file1 file2 ... > init.h. The in your C
	program, just do #include "init.h" anywhere in the *body* of a
	function. This will be equivalent to calling
		lua_dofile("file1"); lua_dofile("file2"); ...

min.c
	The smallest Lua interpreter possible.

setfallback.lua
	An implementation of fallbacks on top of tag methods.
	Useful if you have Lua code written for version 2.5 or earlier.
	If you have C code that uses lua_setfallback, then define LUA_COMPAT2_5
	before building Lua (see config).

trace.c
	A simple execution tracer. An example of how to use the debugging hooks.
